BIG DATA - HIVE

1. Add your chosen data to your GitHub repo (I'd suggest creating one that will be used to load data into your Cloudera VM)

2. Clone (or pull) your data into the Cloudera VM
	cd Documents
	git clone https://github.com/Gayathri-Shanmuga-Sundaram/HDFS_Hive
	git status
	git pull origin master

3. In the VM, use the terminal to create a HDFS folder called data16 located within the /user/cloudera folder.
	hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/cloudera/data16

4. Copy the data from the local filesystem into your HDFS /user/cloudera/data16 folder
	hdfs dfs -put /home/cloudera/Documents/HDFS_Hive/HR-Employee-Attrition.csv /user/cloudera/data16/

5. Using HUE, create a new database called data16 and load your data into this database as a hive table.
	Create database hue editor in HIVE - data16

	hdfs dfs -chmod -R 777 /user/cloudera/data16
	hdfs dfs -ls /user/cloudera/data16

	Upload file

6. Come up with a question that you want to be answered using the data - Create an SQL query to answer this question (do more than select * -- demonstrate filtering and aggregation (such as count or average)

	SELECT department, AVG(monthlyincome) AS avg_salary, COUNT(*) AS num_employees
	FROM hremployeeattrition
	WHERE age > 30 AND attrition = 'Yes'
	GROUP BY department
	ORDER BY avg_salary DESC;
